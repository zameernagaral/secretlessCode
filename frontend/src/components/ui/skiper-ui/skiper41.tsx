              When developers accidentally leak sensitive credentials, the window for remediation is dangerously small. 
              Automated bots scan public repositories 24/7, instantly scraping API keys, database credentials, and cloud tokens.

              <strong>Secretless Code</strong> is built to intercept these mistakes before they become catastrophes. By running 
              ultra-fast, ephemeral scans across your repositories, we identify high-risk exposure without ever 
              storing your code or persisting your sensitive data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your security is our priority. Every scan runs in a sandboxed, memory-only container that is 
              completely purged the moment the analysis is complete. Zero persistence. Total peace of mind.
